## About

Quiz Commander was inspired by my experience using spreadsheets to manage my pub trivia questions (and making a proper mess of it). This app allows hosts to build questions into a library, and then mix and match those questions into new rounds and quizzes. Question types will soon allow for audio and video rounds, and we'll be adding new round types on an ongoing basis. Future improvements also include the ability to export whole quizzes to CSVs, as well as functionality to allow teams to answer questions directly from their phones!

## Features

Quiz Commander is a full stack Rails and React application built for pub trivia hosts. Hosts can build a library of questions using a number of built in question types, add any number of correct (or incorrect) answers, and then use their library of pre-made questions to build rounds and full quizzes.

The Rails backend for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/psan2/Quiz-Commander-Backend-Ruby).
