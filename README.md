Quiz Commander is a full stack Rails and React application built for pub trivia hosts. Hosts can build a library of questions using a number of built in question types, add any number of correct (or incorrect) answers, and then use their library of pre-made questions to build rounds and full quizzes.

The Rails backend for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/psan2/Quiz-Commander-Backend-Ruby).

> Future improvements will include the ability to export whole quizzes to CSVs, as well as functionality to allow teams to answer questions directly from their phones!
