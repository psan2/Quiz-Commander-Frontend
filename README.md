Quiz Commander is a full stack Rails and React application built for pub trivia hosts. Hosts can build a library of questions using a number of built in question types, add any number of correct (or incorrect) answers, and then use their library of pre-made questions to build rounds and full quizzes.

Log in or sign up for a new host account:

Adding a new question lets you specify the type of question, and add as many answers as you like, and toggle the correct ones:
